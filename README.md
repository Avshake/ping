Ping is a latency measurement App that works directly in your web browser. Currently at the moment there is 2 reliable way to do this, using HTTP Fetch and WebSocket.

You can try the App here: https://ping.calvin.al

## Getting Started
- [Installing the WebSocket Ping Server](https://github.com/calvinalx/ping/wiki/Installing-the-WebSocket-Ping-Server)

## Source Code
- Source code for the React client app will be available soon, It's currently a mess, making it unsuitable for public viewing.
- [Geodata Lookup API](https://github.com/calvinalx/geoloc)

## Features
- Measure latency with HTTP/WebSocket
- Real-time Charts
- World Maps
- Geolocation Data
- Change server modals
- Share button
- Dark Mode üÜï

## Planned Features
- Code Refactoring (Yes, the code is a mess right now)
- Show/hide chart toggle
- Better Geolocation data, ability to switch between Origin and Destination
- Ping Multiple servers at once
- Global Latency page / Server browser (Will need servers from all around the world üòÆ)
- Electron App (ICMP support with Node.js)
- Change charts timeframe (5 and 10 minutes or possibly longer)

## Why this was made?
Since the Covid-19 outbreak, I have found my internet connection very unstable, therefore this led me to open Command Prompt all the time doing something like `ping -t google.com` to see how its currently doing.
And I tried finding some ping test site but none of them had a real-time graph or something like that, so I made this üòÅ
